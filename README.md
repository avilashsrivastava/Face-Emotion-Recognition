# Face-Emotion-Recognition
Deep Learning +MLE capstone project [Almabetter pro]

Here I have built a real time face emotion recognition training model and application to detect emotions


# Check out the deployed app:

Azure cloud - https://real-time-face-emotion-recognition-2021.azurewebsites.net

Streamlit cloud - https://share.streamlit.io/avilashsrivastava/face-emotion-recognition/main/app.py

Note - It might take few minutes to load when opening first time. After few minutes reload the page and it should be up running.
I only have free account and less compute resources so the app might be slow.
